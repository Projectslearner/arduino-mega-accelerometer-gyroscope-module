# Accelerometer Gyroscope Module

#### Project Overview

This project involves using an accelerometer and gyroscope module (MPU6050) with an Arduino Mega. The MPU6050 is a 6-axis motion tracking device that provides both accelerometer and gyroscope data. This project will demonstrate how to initialize the MPU6050, configure its settings, and read sensor data, which includes acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes, angular velocity (gyro) in X, Y, and Z axes, and temperature.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the MPU6050 to Arduino Mega:**
   - **VCC** to **5V**
   - **GND** to **GND**
   - **SCL** to **SCL (Pin 21)**
   - **SDA** to **SDA (Pin 20)**

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for and install the following libraries:
     - `Adafruit MPU6050`
     - `Adafruit Unified Sensor`

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the MPU6050 module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor to observe the sensor data.
   - The serial monitor will display acceleration values in m/s^2, angular velocity in rad/s, and temperature in degrees Celsius.

#### Applications

- **Motion Tracking:** Track the movement and orientation of objects or devices.
- **Robotics:** Provide precise movement and balance control for robots.
- **Gaming:** Implement motion-based controls in gaming devices.
- **Health Monitoring:** Track physical activity and body movements.

#### Notes

- Ensure the correct orientation of the MPU6050 module when interpreting acceleration and gyroscope data.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the frequency of data updates.
- Experiment with different accelerometer and gyroscope ranges to suit your specific application needs.
- Calibration may be necessary for accurate measurements in certain applications.
